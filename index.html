<h2>Application Overview</h2>
<p> It will be a really nice html website talking about this class and the first couple sprints that we did.</p>
<h3>Technology Overview</h3>
<p>It will be a HTML and CSS application. I will be using these to create the simple features we learned in class and also go into more depth because I feel like we didnt cover CSS that much during this semester.</p>

<h5>It will just be a website on how this class was and what tips and advice I can give to highschool students who want to prepare.</h5>
<p> It will be a website with varaity of different aspects that can be used in HTML and CSS and I will try to put as much knowlegde about the class experince and really try to help highschoo students as best i can.</p>
<p>However for a Future feature list and If i have time I will try to make it interactive and have a menu displayed on it.</p>
<h6>Basic and Technical fetaures</h6>
<p>Will be using HTML and CSS so will probaly refer back to old code and relearn how to do everything.</p>

<p>However for a Future feature list and If i have time I will try to implent how the drawing connects to me as a person.</p>
<h6>Basic and Technical fetaures</h6>
<p>Will be using turtle so will probaly refer back to old code and relearn how to do everything with covering the distance etc.</p>
<p>for future I would go above and beyond redo the whole text file for example and learn and go into more depth into python and passing things we havent done. </p>
